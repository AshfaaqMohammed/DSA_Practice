Base definition is typical of many recursive definitions of funcitons -
    first, we have one or more base cases,
    which refer to fixed values of the function.
    second, we have one or more recursive cases,
    which define the function in terms of itself.

recursion vs tail recursion -
    recursion - A recursion is not tail recursion if after the recursive call returns, the function still has work to do.
    tail recursion - A recursion is tail recursion if the recursive call is the very last thing the function does.
